                <div class="testimonial">
                    <div class="testimonial-text">We hosted my dad's 60th birthday at Aces Private Resort last February, and overall, it was a really great experience. The staff was helpful from the get-goâ€”especially Jay, who helped us with the set-up and even gave recommendations for caterers in Angeles. The pool area was super clean and my nieces had a blast. There was a bit of a problem with the sound system at first (the microphone kept cutting off), but someone fixed it quickly. I also appreciated that the place was very private, so we could play music and enjoy ourselves without worrying about neighbors. Would definitely consider it again for another family event!</div>
                    <div class="testimonial-author">â€“ Sheila Tan, San Fernando</div>
                </div>
                
                <div class="testimonial">
                    <div class="testimonial-text">Booked Aces for my companyâ€™s team-building retreat last June. Iâ€™ll admit, I was a little skeptical at first because Iâ€™ve been to places that look great online but are disappointing in person. Not the case here. The rooms were spacious, AC was strong (important in Pampanga heat!), and the staff didnâ€™t get in your way but were quick to help if you asked. Only thing is, wifi in some rooms was spotty, so if you need to do Zoom calls, plan ahead. Otherwise, our group loved the karaoke and billiard tables. We even managed to squeeze in a basketball match before dinner. Thanks for the hassle-free experience!</div>

                <div class="testimonial">
                    <div class="testimonial-text">Held my wedding reception at Aces Resort last November, and honestly, couldnâ€™t have asked for a better venue. The gardens were just the right size for our 80 guests, and the staff set up all the tables exactly how I pictured it. The bridal suite was a lifesaverâ€”super comfy and peaceful for getting ready. Only snag was that the catering truck arrived late (not really Acesâ€™ fault though), but the resort team helped us coordinate and kept everything calm. All my guests complimented the ambiance, especially at sunset. Would recommend for anyone who wants a laidback but elegant event.</div>

                        <summary>Do I need any permits or licenses to host a wedding or party at your resort?</summary>
                        <div class="faq-answer">For most private events, you do not need to secure special permits when using our resort. However, if your event involves live bands, fireworks, or extended noise past 10 PM, Angeles City may require additional clearances. Our team will guide you through any local requirements and can assist with the application process if needed.</div>

                        <summary>What is the process for reserving and planning an event at Aces Private Resort?</summary>
                        <div class="faq-answer">The process begins with an initial consultation, either in person or virtually, to discuss your event needs and preferred dates. Once we confirm availability, a 30% deposit is required to secure your reservation. Our event coordinator will then assist you with planning details, such as catering, set-up, decor, and vendor recommendations. The remaining balance is due two weeks before your event date. We offer complimentary site visits for confirmed bookings.</div>
