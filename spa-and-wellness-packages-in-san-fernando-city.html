                <div class="testimonial">
                    <div class="testimonial-text">I booked the spa package for my wife’s birthday last month, and honestly, I wasn’t sure what to expect because we’ve never tried a private resort here before. The staff at Aces Private Resort were really accommodating – they let us check in early so my wife could start her massage right away. The massage itself was legit, not the rushed kind you sometimes get at hotels. My only minor gripe: The sauna could’ve been a bit hotter, but overall we felt super relaxed after. We ended our stay at their pool cabana with some cocktails. Didn’t want to leave! Would recommend for couples looking to chill out for a day or two.</div>
                    <div class="testimonial-author">– Lenin Chavez, Angeles City</div>

                <div class="testimonial">
                    <div class="testimonial-text">Went with my two sisters for a weekend getaway at Aces Private Resort in San Fernando. We did their wellness package—yoga, body scrub, and the signature massage. The yoga instructor was really friendly and patient, which was great since I’m not very flexible! Everything felt clean and safe, and their gardens are beautiful (good for photos, too). We only had an issue with the water pressure in our shower, but when we mentioned it, someone came to fix it fast. Not cheap, but it’s worth treating yourself sometimes. That whole weekend felt like a reset for my mind.</div>

                <div class="testimonial">
                    <div class="testimonial-text">Booked here for an office team building last March. The resort itself is really nice, very private and the spa set-up was a highlight for our group. I got the hot stone massage which was great, but I wish the session lasted longer (it was just under an hour). Food was above average, especially the grilled tilapia. Pool was always clean. Only reason for 4 stars is the traffic getting in and out of San Fernando was pretty bad on a Friday, so maybe avoid the weekend rush if you can.</div>

                        <summary>How far in advance should I book spa services, especially during peak seasons in Pampanga?</summary>
                        <div class="faq-answer">We recommend booking your spa and wellness services at least 2 weeks in advance, particularly during weekends, holidays, or local festivals in San Fernando City when demand is high. Walk-in appointments are subject to availability, but early booking ensures you get your preferred time slot and therapist. For same-day bookings, please call our reservations team to check for open slots.</div>
