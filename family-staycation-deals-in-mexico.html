                <div class="testimonial">
                    <div class="testimonial-text">Spent 2 nights at Aces Private Resort with my family last March for my mom’s birthday. The pool area was bigger than I expected and really clean – my kids didn’t want to get out! We loved that there was a karaoke machine and the kitchen was pretty well equipped, although we had to ask for extra plates since we brought a lot of food. The staff were friendly and gave us tips about local places to buy fresh produce. Only downside was the WiFi got spotty at night, but honestly, we mostly just hung out together so it didn’t matter that much. Would definitely book here again for another family gathering.</div>

                <div class="testimonial">
                    <div class="testimonial-text">We booked Aces Private Resort for a mini-reunion with my college barkada last November. The rooms were spacious and the beds were comfy, even better than what I saw in the photos online. We appreciated the privacy and the fact that we had the whole place to ourselves—no other guests, so we could be as noisy as we wanted! There’s also a grill outside which we used for a late-night barbecue. The only thing was, one of the bathrooms had a leaky faucet, but the caretaker fixed it pretty quickly after we messaged. Overall, it was super sulit for the price and perfect for big groups.</div>

                    <div class="testimonial-text">I stayed here with my husband and our 2 kids last summer break. The best part for us was the pool and the garden space – my kids loved running around, and it felt safe and private. The check-in process was straightforward, but we had to wait around 20 minutes before we could get in because the previous group left late. Not a huge deal, but with little kids it was a bit tiring. Place was very clean and we appreciated the extra towels provided. Would recommend for families looking for a relaxing staycation spot in Pampanga.</div>

To reserve your date, simply contact us through our website or phone. A 50% down payment is required to secure your booking, with the remaining balance due upon check-in. We’ll send you a confirmation and a checklist of what’s included in your stay.</div>
