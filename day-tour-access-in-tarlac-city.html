                <div class="testimonial">
                    <div class="testimonial-text">Booked a day tour for my family at Aces Private Resort last month. The place is really clean, and the pool was perfect for the kids—big enough so we weren’t bumping into other groups, which tends to happen in other resorts we've tried. Staff were pretty attentive but not in your face, which I liked. We had a cabana to ourselves, and the bathrooms were actually decent (I always check this!). Only downside was the food selection—would've liked more snacks, but maybe that’s because we stayed from morning till sunset. Still, we all had a great time and didn’t feel rushed at all.</div>
                    <div class="testimonial-author">– Jayson B., Angeles City</div>

                <div class="testimonial">
                    <div class="testimonial-text">I went here with my barkada for a quick escape from the city stress. Booking was easy, and we got a confirmation right away. When we arrived, the staff welcomed us with cold towels and helped us get settled. The resort itself is Instagrammable—loved the modern vibe and the landscaping. Rented a day cabana, and it was really comfortable for our group of six. We spent most of our time just lounging by the pool and listening to music. Noticed they let us play our own playlists, which was a plus! The only hiccup: our food order took an hour, but at least it tasted good when it came. Would recommend for groups looking for a chill day out.</div>

                    <div class="testimonial-text">Celebrated my daughter’s 18th at Aces Private Resort just last week. Honestly, we wanted something private but still a bit fancy, and this hit the spot. The gardens were perfect for photos, and the day tour package made things affordable for us since not everyone could stay overnight. Staff even helped us set up our simple decorations before guests arrived. Only wished the pool had a bit more shade during midday, but that’s minor. Big thanks to the team for making it smooth—I appreciated the little touches like the welcome drinks and the help with our sound system.</div>

                        <summary>How far in advance should I book a day tour at Aces Private Resort, and what is the reservation process?</summary>
                        <div class="faq-answer">We recommend booking at least two weeks in advance, especially if you’re planning to visit on weekends or during peak months (March–June and December). To reserve your preferred date, simply message us on Facebook or call our front desk. We’ll send you a booking form and payment details. A 50% deposit is required to secure your slot, with the remaining balance due on the day of your visit. Walk-ins are not accepted as we operate exclusively by reservation to ensure privacy for each group.</div>

                        <summary>What happens if it rains on the day of our booking? Do you offer any guarantees or rescheduling options?</summary>
                        <div class="faq-answer">We understand that weather in Tarlac can be unpredictable, especially during the rainy season (June–November).

For light rain, our indoor lounge and covered areas will remain accessible so your group can still enjoy the resort. Please inform us as soon as possible if you need to reschedule due to weather.</div>
